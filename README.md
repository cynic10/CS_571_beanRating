## Project Overview

Coffee is more than just a beverage â€” it's a global culture. With this project, our goal is to understand what makes great coffee and how different characteristics, origins, and production trends affect its quality.

Using a comprehensive dataset and powerful visualizations, **beanRating** allows users to:
- Analyze coffee bean characteristics and how they vary by country.
- Explore relationships between production trends and quality.
- Compare attributes like aroma, flavor, acidity, and more across regions.
- Filter and sort coffee bean data easily through an interactive table.

## Data Processing

We used a Kaggle dataset with ~1000 rows detailing:
- Origin (country, region, altitude)
- Type (species, variety, processing method)
- Production data (bags, weight, year)
- Attribute scores (aroma, flavor, acidity, aftertaste, Body, Balance, Uniformity, Sweetness,	Moisture)

### Cleaning & Transformation Steps
- Handled missing values and standardized formatting.
- Derived a `QualityCategory` (`HIGH`, `MODERATE`, `LOW`) based on total score.
- Grouped and averaged scores by relevant fields to reduce redundancy.
- Split into CSVs for chart-specific use.
